    <h2>Description : </h2>
    <p>These calzones are the real deal because there is no tomato sauce inside! We eat them at least once a week. Have a bowl of tomato or spaghetti sauce on the table for people to top their calzone if desired.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <h3>Dough :</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling :</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup diced pepperoni</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make dough:</strong> Dissolve yeast in warm water in a mixing bowl; let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil, sugar, and salt; mix in 1 cup flour until smooth. Gradually stir in remaining flour until dough is smooth and workable.</li>
        <li><strong>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.</strong> Knead dough until it is elastic, about 5 minutes. Place 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large bowl; lay dough in the bowl and flip to coat with oil. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Make filling:</strong> Meanwhile, combine Cheddar cheese, ricotta cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and basil leaves in a medium bowl. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate to chill.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</strong> Grease a baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Punch down dough;</strong> divide into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece out on a lightly floured surface into 1/8-inch-thick circles. Fill each circle with 1/2 of the cheese and meat filling; fold dough over filling to make a semicircle. Press edges down with the tines of a fork to seal. Brush the top of each calzone with beaten egg and place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake in the preheated oven</strong> until golden brown, about 30 minutes. <em>Serve hot.> </li>
